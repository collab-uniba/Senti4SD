t15;neutral;A few but they all seem proprietary.
t17;negative;To push it to Heroku, you'll have to add it to your repo. Why don't you want to commit it? It's recommended to commit Gemfile.lock in your repo (unless you're developing a gem): When developing an app, check in your Gemfile.lock, since you will use the bundler tool across all machines, and the precision enforced by bundler is extremely desirable for applications.
t19;positive;@Thorbj�rn Ravn Andersen that's really great!
t20;neutral;I'm not sure if this is a case here but if you are really worried about the gc in this case and you'd like to better control behavior of your derived maps and thus their influence on the performance of the gc in my opinion you should take a look at the usage of different kind of references (strong, weak, soft, phantom) in java.Also remember that pre-optimization is a root of all evil especially in programming.

t30;negative;I'm very sorry about my horrible English! only for this example I use radio button, I'm considering using textbox too
t31;neutral;I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not, you really should be!)Most likely, the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads, and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So, while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory.
t32;negative;Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities :It may cause problem while editing--> This can be solved by using some comments--> And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you |.|--> No solution - unless you know more about the code! Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that code--> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think about!EDIT---Some cons:You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit (external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient.You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 KB is faster than 1000 files with 1 KB each.It is safer--> You don't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions. Try to think more about it!
t33;negative;I have just finish that site, but there is a silly bug that remain... if you check tu horizontal position of the WHOLE page there is a slight shift... nothing to cry about but WHY here is the 2 pages any idea, the horizontal css is: i dont like my page to do the cha-cha-cha !
t35;neutral;So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one. I think the example below solved the problem (or at least gives an idea of how to solve it): The extremely ugly for loop construct is really just a placeholder to give an example of how the axes can be swapped.
t37;negative;Lastly, I don't see any styling data. Does your project have some CSS defined somewhere?

Click the triangle and select ""Flame Chart"". Once you are in Flame Chart mode, you can zoom and pan to see the digest cycles, how long they take, and exactly what functions are being called. The Flame Chart is so incredibly useful for tracking down page load issues, ng-repeat performance problems, digest cycle problems! I really don't know how I was able to debug and profile before the Flame Chart. Here is an example:"

t41;neutral;The function signature for pthread_create requires a function that returns . Also, returned from should be treated opaquely. Both of these changes are reflected below and compile on my machine: UPDATE: There are some other issues with your program as well. For example, it's very likely that main will exit before your thread runs. You should join on your thread if you want to make sure it exits first. Using raw pthreads is a great way to learn about threads but can be very very painful compared to some of the pre-existing frameworks out there - try boost::thread or std::thread if you want to just get up and running with as little hassle as possible.

t57;positive;Excellent! Look forward to hearing from you.
t59;neutral;Okay, I see your confusion and edited my response with some sample code/an appropriate link to wikipedia. You are confusing the entropy of the model's probability distribution with the cross entropy (or likelihood) of the predictions it makes on real data. Consider a model that assigns probability 1 to some event and probability 0 to everything else. It has 0 entropy, but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that isn't a purely non-random sequence, assigning 0 probability to events that actually happen.

t82;neutral;I need the page to include the sitemap because I'm saving context from each of the three previous pages. That way the user can click the previous page in the sitemap, and it will load the data I stored (i.e. load the data from their previous search).
t85;positive;There is another way... As the WPF application is coded with the .NET framework, it is compiled to MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language).

My problem though is that I simply want to stop that. It's extremely annoying and happens every now and then during the execution. But I can't find any setting anywhere which will prevent breaking inside class files. How do I avoid this?

t104;positive;It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function. By the way, this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it, it's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!
t105;negative;I want to duplicate a very large table, but I do not want to copy it row by row. Is there a way to duplicate it? For example, you can TRUNCATE w/o deleting row/row, so i was wondering if there is something similar for copying entire tables UPDATE: row by row insert is very painful (because of 120M rows). Anyway to avoid that?

I got rid of , , and since you can just as easily enter the value directly.Then I got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder, and just added the content to the log file defined earlier. I changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type, date, and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file.Lastly I changed the whole If>ElseIf>ElseIf thing into a Switch, because Switch is awesome and totally underused! Oh yeah, I got rid of because it's pointless to define a variable and then just echo it. What you could do is in the section have it write-host the error and call the log function again, so people are forced to enter a valid entry.

It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.

t187;positive;"I second trying to put the whole path instead. For relative paths, if you're doing compiling and running in command line/terminal, you need to have that studentrecords.txt in the same directory of your code files.If you're using an IDE, you need to put your studentrecords.txt under the src/ folder. This is assuming you're not in maven project setup; otherwise it should be put under /src/main/java/resources/ .Hope this helps!"

t189;negative;whenever i drag-n-drop a stored procedure onto my Context canvas, the parameters/arguments for the stored procedure are all nullable. Why is this? Is it because of how i've declared my parameters inside the stored procudure itself? Besides manually creating my stored procedure methods in the Context partial class (or drag-n-drop onto canvas, cut from autogen'd code, move to partial class, then remove nullables types) .. is there any way to fix this? It's really frustrating :(

t203;negative;So, the following hack seems to work, but it's really incredibly ugly IMO, as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning. Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font-size, and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div. I'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in Webkit you probably won't find an elegant solution for your problem.

t260;neutral;At a guess, you're probably defining your objects in VB as just s, something like this: If so, you're forcing VB to go through the automation interface (IDispatch). Basically, it doesn't know what type you're going to assign to until run-time, so it has to invoke methods on that object via IDispatch::Invoke. To do that, it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.By contrast, your C++ code is probably early-bound, which means offsets into the COM object's vtable are compiled directly into your code. In that case, when/if you change the code so those offsets aren't valid any more, the code will fail horribly.

t266;positive;First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.

t344;neutral;A couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as follows:Do not EVER escape binary data prior to insertionInserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge no-no. This can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple SQL injection.That being said, it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into, nor how large the image file is. Storing a 2GB upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea, but if you wanted to store large images, it is recommended to stream the data into a BLOB field.For smaller files, you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space.

t371;negative;Your are really violating the idea of TDD if your code if doing something different for the Test. Why do you only need to change it inside the test?
t374;neutral;I've re-read my comment, and it says what I meant it to say.
t375;positive;@Oded thank you this tool is very great!
t377;negative;put your path and your shadow in a set. apply your animation to the set and it'll affect both. a really terrible example where I move both at once.
t378;positive;"Yep I've been testing some stuff recently under Safari 5.1.5 (WinXP) recently and when you have elements with tabindex=""0"", all the elements EXCEPT links ( with ""href"" defined) are focusable. By all elements, I mean s, s etc. It's absolutely amazing for me from the accessibility point of view!"
t379;negative;Still printed but had that dreaded extra page! -_-

t382;positive;Excellent answer, thanks! Wish I could give you more points.
t383;negative;I have developed a cumulative sum function as defined below in the Haskell library Repa. However, I have run into an issue when combining this function with the transpose operation. All 3 of the following operations take well under a second: However, if I write: performance degrades horrendously. While each individual operation in isolation takes well under a second on a 1920x1080 image, when combined they now take 30+ seconds... Any ideas on what could be causing this? My gut tells me it has something to do with delayed arrays, not forcing at the right time, etc... But I do not have enough experience to track this down quite yet.
t385;positive;No worries Stephen!
t386;neutral;The following program prints 0, not std::string::npos as I expected. Why?
t387;negative;If I have a setup project in a VS 2010 solution and I add/remove another project, or unload/reload another project any setup projects in the solution are expanded in the solution explorer. It only does this for setup projects and it is extremely annoying. Is there any way to disable this behaviour?
t388;positive;sounds like desirable behaviour to me! How do you make it do that again?!?
t389;positive;"I appreciate your warm welcome, I never seen such a warm regard here for trying to be helpful, it was a really pleasant introduction and I want to thank you for taking your time to write - at last the end of the questions reads ""If anyone has any ideas I would be extremely grateful!"""
t390;positive;Excellent point! Thanks!! I did mean just the left side though.. (I should have specified that). Was glad to learn your insight though..
t392;positive;Thanks. That was a really great pointer!
t393;positive;Excellent, this works perfectly! Thank you :)
t394;positive;Excellent, Thanks!
t395;negative;@MikeChristensen that's horrible :| and weird!!

t404;neutral;Including an external jsp page as an innerHtml from a javascript function
t406;neutral;Maybe you can post the relevant code snippet? Regards, tamberg
t407;neutral;I'm getting a 404 when I try to check that link... do you need to edit the html?
t409;positive;Stu Nicholls's site has a lot of examples of how to do this without javascript. It's a really excellent resource.
t411;negative;yes it does it in IE8 as well. Very annoying !
t414;positive;Yes, you need two view controllers. Check out lesson 7 from Stanfords CS193P iPhone Application Programming course. It is available online. Both slides and the lecture through iTunes U. I really enjoyed watching the course!
t415;negative;"Out of all that pseudocode, the only thing that really worries me is ""extracts code samples from file"". Reading files from a directory is trivial, saving a file is trivial. Regardless of the test framework I'd spend most of my time focusing on the parsing bit. For direct testing, I'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an Array (or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself."
t416;positive;no worries! it happens all the time.
t418;negative;as you can see folks hate spending time giving details on bad advice!
t419;neutral;We can do this quite neatly using numpy, without having to worry about the channels at all! output: input:
t420;neutral;Answer coming late. But anyway ... here goes: If it's indeed PIC S9(9) COMP and not COMP-3 then it's not a 'sinister' COBOL packed field but a simple 4 byte integer!
t423;positive;I ended up using , which met all my needs and is (IMO) very excellent.
t424;negative;Back in the day I had to solve this with a panel where the text box is a component inside and had DockPadding set to 3 or 4 pixels. I'd then style that panel to a single pixel. I always found this really annoying!
t425;negative;the two are not mutually exclusive, archmage.
t427;neutral;+1 for code sample
t428;positive;Wow great answer and very quick!. Explained everything.
t429;positive;Excellent, injekt!!! Loved the way you answered.
t430;positive;Absolutely. Don't be afraid to just try stuff out!

t450;neutral;How can i extract data from a 2d array.. e and b are indexes of the array
t451;negative;I have a fairly large codebase with several directories and files and I would like to check out a view or have a view as of a given date (Septermber 12th). I am manually checking file histories and doing and this is extremely painful. I wonder if there is a way to do a checkout and load everything as of a particular day at once?
t452;positive;You might want to look into JAXB. If you have a defined XML schema it will automatically create java classes that will easily allow you to 'marshal' (move data from java -> XML) and much much more. It's incredibly useful!
t453;neutral;Using a Inside the delegate for the TextField.TextChanged put this:
t454;positive;No worries! IE11 does a poor job of emulating other browser versions.
t456;negative;I've discovered that my Python code is a lot flatter than my C++ code. Don't know why.

t459;positive;my pleasure :) :)
t460;positive;Related: Doug Lea put this up last week, pretty awesome!
t462;neutral;Felix Geisend�_rfer from Debuggable has some really excellent examples of how to utilize Set::extract to get multiple values from various nested data structures
t463;neutral;Do need this for existing documents or generated on fly ones?
t464;positive;You can try the (very) comprehensive jeff's OR go with this simple workaround: And then declare the attribute as an integer: This worked very fine for me! =D
t465;neutral;You can use with an existing profile:
t466;neutral;I've been having a spam problem on my site, where people sign up and act extremely abusive to other users of my site. I can easy IP ban them, except they always come back under a different IP address through a proxy or TOR. So I was curious if there are any php classes or functions that can look up the IP and determine if its a genuine user, or someone behind a proxy, in which case it would muzzle their accounts upon registration.

t478;negative;I agree with this. For *non-essential services* increasing timeouts is incredibly frustrating.
t479;negative;There's an error here: $r3 only has one result column (which you haven't given a name). Are you sure you are using the correct variable because there's no way that your code should work as you have posted it. Also your variable naming is really awful. Use meaningful names instead of , , etc...
t482;negative;OK, then, no solution that going DB mysql... so sad ! :-( i will close the question !
t483;negative;@Aggieboy that's really sad, and I have to hand-code stuff .

t487;negative;"""in the second instance run the designer, and the breakpoint will fire""...does not fire..."
t488;negative;That is awful advice! I don't mean to be overtly mean but I lolled.
t489;neutral;So, which solution did you go for in the end?
t490;negative;Oh, absolutely horrible practice. But still the answer he was looking for.
t491;positive;The link works for me. That is a pretty awesome testing class! Thanks Andrew. I think I am going to convert and use that in my Silverlight project. Thanks for the tip about Caliburn, Josh G. I'll have a look at that too! :)
t492;negative;Effective, but what a pain! You'd think there'd be an easier way.
t493;neutral;C++ isn't dying, but most of its strengths only shine in niche markets.
t494;negative;Putting data in the ID is a terrible, terrible idea.
t495;neutral;Absolutely: Jersey is The Thing to use for JSON-based/aware web services.
t496;neutral;This only works if the compiler switch AssignableConsts is turned on
t497;positive;AutoHyperlinks (https://bitbucket.org/sholt/autohyperlinks2/overview) is a pretty excellent library for this purpose.

t503;positive;Horray for Android!
t504;negative;avoid the auto method, to apply by hand is such painful :(

t516;negative;I got to this question via the Almighty Google. To complement on what Andrew said above, for those of you on OSX you might want to take a peek at /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/indent/html.vim and the modifications necessary should become evident. I can't believe I spent so much time suffering from poorly indented <li>s!
t517;positive;excellent, thanks to both of you!
t518;neutral;No, n % 7 + 1 actually returns n + 1 unless n == 7 in which case it returns 1.

t523;negative;From my experiences so far, I've concluded that the HTML5 Manifest scheme was really terribly designed. My site serves a manifest file when a user is logged in. Unfortunately, when they log out, they can still access the cached protected materials. Can anyone think of a way to fix this?

t540;negative;Maybe someone knows how to disable content assist only on 'else' keyword when working with PHP source editor in Aptana? As I really, really hate it with this keyword, because after newest release it's really messing with my workflow as after entering 'else' and pressing enter it replaces it with: and sometimes it decides to get rid of indents completely. Mind you I don't want to disable content assist completely, I just want to disable it for 'else' keyword.
t541;neutral;If you really worry about the performance, divide the page content into separate section and run the search process parallel !!!
t542;positive;Check out Bruce Dunwiddie's excellent class. It provides really excellent information in the exception messages when you have this kind of mapping issue.
t544;positive;You should really check out this plugin: I have been using it for about 10 sites and it's really great! Since the latest update it's posible to export your custom fields to a PHP file which you can include your functions.php
t545;neutral;oh ok...I forgot php considered empty strings as FALSe, though it was just 0 and null

t551;neutral;What is your current function?
t552;neutral;Which language and/or regex engine is it for?
t553;neutral;Yup because I am doing a search, unless you know another way.
t554;positive;Well, I was using the setControlValueToUpperCase() method too soon it seems. So changing my keydown first if statement to fixed my issue. Horray Me!!

I would like to know if it could be possible to have a panel with all balloons to drag/drop on the map? My current development : My target :"
t558;positive;+1 excellent!..
t559;positive;Excellent! Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.
t560;neutral;Is there a convenient way to check if a directory is empty using MSBuild?
t562;positive;you actually can use HTML5 tech to apply on that beside, you can use a gem 'client-side validation' the github is here I suggest you use the gem...pretty awesome :D

t564;neutral;You can define an External. and a little more on the how-to side...
t565;neutral;DELETE command doesn't work with JOIN
t566;negative;Horribly inefficient! It re-encodes the image each time. Try this instead.
t567;neutral;You have to be excruciatingly careful when there are spaces in the path names. In the context, you probably need: You don't need quotes around the variable this time.
t568;positive;I am using 'simpLESS' program to compile my .less files into .css files on the fly. It is really great! However, after using it only for couple of days, 'simpLESS' stopped copiling the .less into .css files. I have tried to reinstall, redownload and then reinstall, tried other directories, other .less files, tried recompiling manuall - but nothing works. Has anyone experienced this? Thanks!
t569;negative;Oh, this was was a pain! I probably lost 2 hours on this. Here is the solution: CMake uses short 'C' applications to test/try things. If the CMakeLists.txt states that C++ is used for the project, without also listing C, then some of those shorts tests incorrectly fail, and cmake then thinks those things aren't found. The solution was to change the first line of CMakeLists from this: ...to include C as a language: Then delete , recreate it, and everything then works:

t575;negative;I am building the Android OS on Mac OSX (Lion), and Eclipse as an IDE. I am trying to understand certain parts of the OS however this requires performing many searches throughout the project. These searches take 5 or 10 minutes on Eclipse, and the way they are presented is also extremely annoying. Also, I need a separate editor to open up the native files found in the OS, since if they are opened in Eclipse there is no color coding of the C++ syntax. I feel that Eclipse is really slowing me down - can anyone suggest a better IDE for browsing the Android OS (preferably free)?
t576;negative;I recently worked on a product that was targeted to .NET 3.5. Out of hundreds of beta testers, I can probably count on one hand the number that already had .NET 3.5. The rest had to sit through the absolutely painful .NET 3.5 install from microsoft (~30 minutes, and most of the time the progress bar stays near 0 so people think it is broken).

t579;neutral;Test code: How do I remove the whitespaces before storing it into the array?
t580;negative;I wish I'd have found this question yesterday, as it has been causing me grief for hours! Surely this is a bug with the emulator?
t582;neutral;Yeah I agree, I use igoogle to read all the news at one place, check my gmail, gcalender, etc.

t588;neutral;Don't rely too much on cplusplus.com
t589;neutral;The search bots don't care about hash tags. And if you are using them for some kind of flash or AJAX calls, you have more serious problems than your 301 redirects don't work. Because unless you have the content in an alternate form, the search engines are not indexing your site and you are definitely suffering as far as SEO goes.
t591;positive;That answer was extremely helpful Scott, thanks for the pointer on that!
t593;neutral;Why dont you simply wrap the absolutely excellent XOM with implicit conversions and such? Yes, it won't give you scala's XML-native-syntax style out of the box...
t595;neutral;There's no need to spawn new processes, simply re-use them between requests.
t596;negative;I'm trying to do this in a makefile and it fails horribly: do you know why? I guess it has to do with escaping, but what and where?

t628;neutral;I can only help if I can see the full (ie. non-compressed) source code.

t640;negative;I am working on an app that uses some basic view types, but I find the default attributes extremely ugly in Android (for example, a bright yellow ). I can get the basic seekbar if I create it from code, using only the parameter, but I would like to know if there is a way to do this inside an XML Layout file. Is there an attribute I can set that will remove all default attributes - such as ?

Due to legacy databases also on the server I am targeting, I am not able to re-configure the default connection settings as is quite rightly stated in the accepted answer in .

t657;neutral;Here is another one to consider http://tableview.codeplex.com
t659;positive;Here are my tables. And here are my object classes I'm brand new to dapper and orm in general, so please bare with me. Would a many-to-many relationship be possible to map out with dapper? If so, could someone provide a coding sample, that would be extremely helpful! I am also open to switching to a heavier orm if that would make these advanced mapping scenarios a lot simpler.
t660;neutral;You can't use multiple colors on an icon font, so what you ask isn't possible. You could use a partial background fill, but that doesn't seem very desirable. If you switch to you would at least have access to symbols.

t679;negative;I found this great node mysql boilerplate: it works terrific! However, now I need to hook it in to my existing user table, and my key field is named userID, not simply id, and changing the key fieldname in mysql breaks the example. So my question is, where in the project do I need to specify a different id field name? I see user.id in /util/auth.js passport.serializeUser and id in passport.deserializeUser functions, but it seems it must be specified elsewhere too.

This also gives you the advantage of reusability from the view to any controller, and since dealloc will get rid of those from the UIView, you only worry about cleanup once!
t946;negative;The question on how to check input for validity is answered numerous times! You just check whether the stream is in a good state. If not, you'll reset the stream and ignore the character. Search for question where this answered. Also, don't use exceptions for non-exceptional cases and *always* throw something derived from `std::exception`: once you have tried to locate where an exception came from which isn't derived from `std::exception` in a program with a few million lines of code you'll find it extremely helpful to look at what `what()` returns!

The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.

Like so: I've created a new xml layout for the layout parameter in the ArrayAdapter except when I bind the TextView to the string array, it only sets the text to the TextView with the given id. I've also searched through the other posts about this one and it did not suit my needs. If anyone could help that would be absolutely great :) Thank you.

t2009;negative;I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?

t2266;positive;I would like to get back all the option selected of a multiple select when i submit my form. like : using somthing like that : and get an array with all the value selected like ['2','3'] All that, without jQuery and in js or php is fine :) thx!
t2267;neutral;The clue is: If you actualy have defined the table, then you have suffered the major (probably only!) sqlite gotcha. If the database file doesnt exits it will quietly create an empty database for you. Double check you file path and look for a new empty sq3 file appearing in your directory.
t2271;positive;"I have discovered a mode in , where I can instantly change all same variables. When I am in this mode I get a box around the same variables and I can change one and instantly all others change. I do not know how to enter this mode ""by will"", I just entered it ""randomly"". Therefore, I really appreciate your suggestions, how to enter this mode, because it is extremely useful to me! PS.: I am using NO plugins, just a plain new eclipse installation with java!"

t2293;negative;I am referring to this behaviour: (Windows doesn't include the mouse cursor in the screen shot, I'm hovered on the uppermost (+) here.) I find this incredibly annoying in some cases, especially with larger methods. In , I have both checkboxes blank.
t2295;negative;I used multiple requests - batches of 10. I don't want to anger the Api!
t2296;positive;excellent in my case use the following code Thanks!!
t2297;negative;I got very angry with Oracle today after reading lots of editable TableView solutions involving setOnEditCommit, which is just NOT the right way it should be done. Following is a much better and simpler solution I found after digging the JavaFX source:
t2299;neutral;Also, you need to use `$(this)` instead of just `this`
t2300;negative;Still no go, I am afraid :/ This does not remove 'www' from the url.

t2305;neutral;What NSMutableArray methods correspond to these Javascript Array methods?
t2306;neutral;This is by design - & is usually a desirable outcome! Linq-to-SQL inserts child objects to preserve relational integrity. If you can turn that off somehow, the next obvious solution is to remove the relationship. This is not an ideal suggestion but it will work. Now A does not have a ClassB object, and hence the Insert statement will not insert your B.

t2314;positive;"Thank you for the excellent answers! @ArnoldSpence is correct: It is indeed a case of memory fragmentation. I confirmed this by modifying my example above to allocate a series of 49 MB buffers after the reaching the ""OUT OF MEMORY"" condition. Sure enough, these all succeeded (up to the 2GB limit)."

What are the possible ways to inform the application users about the features of the application? I personally find the ""Tip of the day"" popups extremely annoying and disable them quickly. Are there better ways?"

t2326;neutral;You should be more explicit as to which RDBMS you are using.
t2327;negative;If it's forms auth then yes, that's weird. I'm afraid I don't have any idea!
t2328;neutral;If you're really worried about string/character size, have you thought about compressing them? That would automatically reduce the string to it's 'minimal' encoding. It's a layer of headache, especially if you want to do it in memory, and there are plenty of cases in which it wouldn't buy you anything, but encoding, especially, tend to be too general purpose to the level of compactness you seem to be aiming for.

t2346;negative;Link is down again.
t2347;neutral;Is this ASP .NET or WinForms?
t2348;neutral;Not really, you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it, because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file, so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them, but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.
t2349;positive;I am trying to make my javascript change when the window resizes, but cannot seem to get it to work. The only difference I would like is for the offset().top to change from -90 to -60 as the window becomes smaller than 768px. This is what I have so far: Any advice would be really great! Thank you

t2369;neutral;I'm running socket.io/node.js on my EC2 auto-scaling array of servers. As soon as I have more than 1 server, there is the obvious problem where the socket.io connections need to be shared between the servers. This is where you'd normally use the redis store plugin that comes with socket.io. Unfortunately, I use MongoDB (not redis), and the cost of adding another database to my stack would be prohibitively high. I tried using the module, but it absolutely killed my servers (huge CPU usage). Is there any other way to share the socket.io session between EC2 servers?
t2370;negative;Is this seriously the only way to modify the default template? This seems absolutely terrible.

t2405;positive;@R.. Wow! Really great answer!! You should post it as an answer here, as it's really more precise. Just a question, though, when you say round for the alignment of the type, you mean that if for example on your example you had a short b instead of int b, it would be aligned to offset 2, instead of 1?
t2406;neutral;No I did not. The question is - which files..
t2407;positive;Ah - excellent - thanks!
t2408;positive;I am designing a contact form which has a 'Thank you' message pop up on send, I need my thank you message to be positioned relative, other wise if the user happens to scroll while the animation is running the message remains stuck in place and ruins the animation. However positing the div relative keeps it in the position before it loads, what I need is a way to have the div display:none or opacity:0 BEFORE the send button is pressed, is that possible? Here is an to explain what I'm trying to achieve a little better And below is the Javascript I'm using Any help would be really appreciated :) Thanks guys!

This is absolutely a bug in Azure deployment as near as I can figure. I had to drop & recreate my site in the cloud and the deployment continued to work. As a side rant. Microsoft makes it extremely painful for someone to submit a bug as compared to other software vendors. And they wonder why their market share is shrinking.
t2481;neutral;If your end goal is to add elements to your page, just manipulate the DOM directly. Don't use string concatenation to try to create HTML - what a pain!

I just don't know how to replace a TextRange with a UI control... Would extremely appreciate your help :-) ! Gili
t2489;negative;I think it should be a warning. Generally speaking, the common rule is that 'you should treat warnings as errors'. If I unintentionally write unreachable code, I will see it in the warnings, and fix it anyway. However, sometimes, like Neil says, you intentionally create dead code, for debugging purposes or whatever reason. I'd really, really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that.

I have resorted to using Component One studio for Silverlight in order to achieve this, and even then it hasn't been exactly a walk in the park. Consider C1 Data Grid control. Here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up. The down side of such solutions is that C1's controls are extremely expensive :( I wish Micro$oft came up with some enhancements in SL5 that would accommodate for such issues.

t2544;positive;I use GIT on windows with and i'm loving it! .
t2545;negative;I have run into this too. It is very annoying! Here's why it might be happening. The width of your li items, plus any margins is more than the width of #maincontainer. That means the last li item spills over #maincontainer and the script will want to move that last bit in, leaving an extra click. One way to check this: assign an id to the last li, and make the width less, and see if that doesn't fix it. If so you need to make the #maincontainer wider.

These applications will most of the time be running on computers that have limited/old hardware. We are now a little worried that the hardware might be too limited for using WPF. We have installed Family.Show () on an basic older computer and that seems to run ok. But we would like know what your experiences with WPF on older hardware is? Anyone out there willing to share some experiences with us?

t2589;positive;Gotta love stackoverflow!
t2590;negative;I usually don't post meta comments, but 29k views and 7 upvotes? That is sad
t2591;negative;In this case, I'd keep the DoStuff() method but subscribe to it with: Admittedly that won't please those who do all their event wiring in the designer... but I find it simpler to inspect, personally. (I also hate the autogenerated event handler names...)
t2593;positive;Jeff's article is excellent reading on this topic.
t2594;positive;+1. Great question! Now, I have no clue about the answer, but I'll stay tuned.
t2596;neutral;Make sure the designer doesn't put anything that he thinks is fancy and well animated. Many a times, it becomes a big pain to simulate such effects in ASP.net unless you are a pro with CSS or Javascript. Coordination between designer and developer is a must according to me, so I would prefer to sit close to a designer till the base design of the page is finalized.
t2597;neutral;It's free in both meanings of the term.
t2599;neutral;Your question assumes that mail clients follow the RFC standards for MIME encoding, which they don't. I'd advise you collect a bunch of mail from sources and try and process it as-it-exists. The problem you are facing is extremely difficult (perhaps impossible) to solve 100%.
t2600;neutral;"When all of the bugs from previous patches get merged into the main tree, we lose the ""who did what"" information. I think it is a shortcoming of TFS for sure. Too many bug fix comments hurt in the long term - people are then afraid to touch stuff."
t2601;neutral;I maintain an application which, during the course of two years, has constantly required new hardware to be even usable, due to the amount of new users / new data inserted. However, justifying the investiment is sometimes very hard to do. I started to wonder - how can I establish the maximum number of users a web application currently suports? I thought of using JMeter scripts but they can get really nasty to implement when having to simulate file transfers and decison trees. What do you guys use?
t2602;neutral;I need to send and receive data over serial connections (RS-232 and RS-422). How do I set up and communicate with such a connection? How do I figure out what the configuration settings (e.g. baud rate) should be and how do I set them? In particular I am looking to do this in Java, C/C++, or one of the major Unix shells but I also have some interest in serial programming using Windows/Hyperterminal.
t2604;negative;This is how you find the arc length given the parameter, but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function. Getting from one to the other is not trivial. @Christian Romo: how did you do it? I mean, you can just use binary search, but that would be horribly slow (for what I'm trying to do, anyway).

t2619;neutral;I want an simple IDE/editor for C in Linux to which I can add features easily. For example: I want to add a right click menu item and a related action for the editor. It should be easy to extent and add any desirable functionality.

t2620;neutral;"The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem."

t2634;neutral;Why is Silverlight included in the question title? SQLLite is not yet ported to Silverlight 2, and what you do on the server side doesn't really matter for the Silverlight client application.
t2635;positive;Ahh, I didn't know that the wsdl command line utility could generate one file for many asmx.... thats awesome! I'll try that out now. I can integrate that into our build process too. Great, thank!
t2636;neutral;It could also be a problem if you worried about running out of ID too fast (if you expect LOTS of records), since you're only using 1/10 of the range you have storage for.
t2637;neutral;I always try to avoid to return string literals, because I fear they aren't defined outside of the function. But I'm not sure if this is the case. Let's take, for example, this function: Is this correct code? It does work for me, but maybe it only works for my compiler (gcc). So the question is, do (string) literals have a scope or are they present/defined all the time.
t2638;negative;I have created a VB.Net lending application for a cooperative that caters to widows. The application tracks the members' loans and payments, and is also used as an accounting system. In my first release, the users felt that showing a messagebox every time an error occurs is very annoying. My solution is to output errors in a label control. The users accepted the modification, but i feel i am doing it wrong.
t2639;positive;Im using the AutoPersistenceModel in Fluent NHIbernate to map all my entities and that all works fine :D However, several of my objects have In the database there is a single comments table, and each entity with the above code, has its own link table to comments. At the moment what im doing is: for every entity. Is there some way i can set a convention where by all mappings to IList<Comment> are wired up automatically as manytomany with the above table name convention? Thanks Andrew

t2643;positive;Wow! Yeah, I did'nt know that! Great new feature.
t2644;negative;I'm writing an Eclipse plugin for the JDT. I need a functionality that tracks certain strings or regular expressions and possibly creates markers. I know that Eclipse already does that for //TODO comments, for example (creating task markers for them) but I'm not sure if I can use the same mechanism. I can write my own but worried it would be too inefficient and not sensitive enough to code chnanges.
t2645;negative;This is a terrible idea, as a compact on a database already in a suspect state can lose data that would otherwise be recoverable before the compact. Compact On Close should under all circumstances be turned OFF.

t2652;negative;hI, I'm trying to get this code from Larry Nyhoff's book to compile in Bloodshed. It's actually been taken word for word from the author's website, though I declared it on .cpp instead of .h (the .h file ain't working with the tester application). The search(const DataType & item) function is what's giving me grief. The compiler error says: What I'm I missing here?
t2654;negative;Restoring splitter distances has given me a lot of grief too. I have found that restoring them from my user settings in the form (or user control) Load event gave much better results than using the constructor. Trying to do it in the constructor gave me all sorts of weird behaviour.
t2655;neutral;Any, but Solaris especially loves threads.
t2656;neutral;While your basic point is correct, the code you've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: Afaik, you get four `int` in one cache line, that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data (not considering prefetching), you have conditional jumps in your loop (modern architectures hate mispredicting those), so you get much, much more than a cycle for each loop iteration. I'd wager, your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles, probably more, but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping (how many mispredictions are made).
t2657;negative;I guess that works, but I'd never do that. It's screaming bad practice. Think about code readability etc.. Come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your HTML markup.
t2659;negative;My form receives asynchronous callbacks from another object on random worker threads. I have been passing the data to the main thread (where it can be used to update onscreen controls) using delegates as shown below. Performance is dreadful -- once I reach 500 updates per second, the program completely locks up. My GUI processing itself is not the problem, as I can simulate this level of updating within the form and have no problems. Is there a more efficient mechanism I should be using to hand off the data from thread to thread?

t2662;neutral;I am looking at moving my company's internal business app from VB.NET to PHP. Some of the people were worried about losing GUI features that can be found in .NET. I am under the impression that with the right javascript framework, anything in .NET GUI can be replicated. While I am still researching this point, I would like to ask if form features in .NET GUI can in fact be replicated with javascript and slightly more importantly, will it take much longer to develop to get the same results?
t2663;neutral;I have wrist pain when I type and I would like to start writing SQL statements, stored procedure, and views using speech recognition.

t2669;positive;Does anyone know of a link to a reference on the web that contains a sample English dictionary word script, that can be used to populate a dictionary table in SQL Server? I can handle a .txt or .csv file, or something similar. Alternatively, I'm adding custom spellchecking functionality to my web apps...but I don't want to integrate the standard components. If there are good references (with samples) on building a dictionary word checker, I'd love that too!
t2670;neutral;To further explain: Apple once had a section in their agreement that specifically listed the allowable programming languages C, C++, Objective-C and Javascript. This was cause for a lot of confusion, doubts and fear. Eventually Apple stopped naming the languages. I know for a fact that even while this was in place, a variety of apps were on the store, being published, or in development that used Lua scripting in some way or another.

t2701;negative;My application links against libsamplerate.a. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it doesn't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg. libc. What exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a? Just libsamperate's bytecode? Or more?

t2719;neutral;This code is 99% correct. However, if we call Peek or Pop without putting anything on the stack, it will crash as the index is -1. This could be easily fixed by adding index bounds checking.
t2720;negative;might be an answer, but I'm afraid I can't speak from experience.
t2721;neutral;If I understand this correctly: Current CPU developing companies like AMD and Intel have their own API codes (the assembly language) as what they see as the 2G language on top of the Machine code (1G language) Would it be possible or desirable (performance or otherwise) to have a CPU that would perform IL handling at it's core instead of the current API calls?

t3232;positive;Awesome! I'm actually familiar with SDL. I'm going to look into this.
t3233;positive;I find by Martin Fowler to be an excellent overview of a variety of UI architectures. Hope it helps :)

t3235;neutral;After reading a discussion on Ubuntu Forums concerning . Is GLUT dead for graphics programming? Is SDL all the rage now for OpenGL programming?
t3237;positive;+1 Fantastic question! I have no idea when I would ever use this, but I'm fascinated to know someone needs this.
t3240;negative;For instance, will I be able to create an application that allows users to create and modify existing types at runtime? Will I be able to persist instances of those types in SQL without having to worry about the user who adds 100,000 records and expects a (really) fast query on them? Think SharePoint Content Types... but on steroids. Oslo steroids - Possible or not?
t3242;neutral;You should definitely HTML encode before assigning posted content to the HTML body of an email. Your code should already be rejecting content such as '<script>' as invalid, not just in the case of an email but in all cases. There are no other considerations you need to worry about.
t3243;neutral;"`internal` exists so that API vendors (such as MS) can write classes without worrying about random strangers using their code. Whenever an API becomes public, the vendor can no longer easily change the signatures. When `internal`, if MS chooses to, they can change their code without fear of breaking other people's code. That is, unless they are using reflection to ""cheat""."
t3244;negative;that's some very dangerous advice!
t3246;positive;Awesome! Its resolve my issue. But is there any way to copy/move files with billion of numbers and without removing existing files/folders ?
t3248;positive;I've got an application that I'm moving over to ClickOnce and the app has a moderately sized data folder with hundreds of files that I need to inlcude in the deployment. The folder needs to be in the same place relative to the EXE after deployment. I've seen several suggestions on how to do this but there doesn't seem to be a agreed upon method for doing this. Any suggestions would be great - Thanks!
t3249;neutral;try f-in-box flajector.
t3250;neutral;That would be unlikely. It depends on the randomness of the generated account number and the number of active accounts. With managed code you have to recurse 10s of thousands of times in order to break the stack. When the probability of non-uniqueness approaches 10,000:1, then it's time to worry.
t3253;neutral;"What do you mean by ""implement it""? How to avoid violating the rule?"
t3255;positive;I've used the ExprTk library in the past, it's easy to use and fast in evaluation. http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html
t3257;negative;rmeader: if you have clients who can barely restart their computer it is a pain. And from what I heard some versions of windows don't automatically synch time ...
t3258;positive;it was very helpful :)
t3259;neutral;The MIT licensed might be the right solution. It's a complete managed port of SQLite, so it can be used with Silverlight.
t3260;positive;that is what I am doing now. I find this a more practical solution and I see there are other people doing the same. Well, great!
t3261;negative;"Shortcut keys often don't work the same way across all browsers. And they are awful on Opera. And most users won't use them. The only thing I'd bother with on most sites is buttons for next and prev, and I'd also make the alt tag say ""next"" or ""previous"" to assist browsers with fast forward."
t3262;positive;I can't get any event triggers to work. A simplified example of what I'm doing is below - I know there is a event on Border since it is defined in but I'm still getting Cannot convert string 'MouseEnter' in attribute 'RoutedEvent' to object of type 'System.Windows.RoutedEvent' as soon as i run the application. Any help would be hugely appreciated.
t3263;positive;The Java profiler is an excellent commercial solution. You can find further information in the docs on and .

t3265;neutral;You might be able to use an anti-CSRF token to achieve what you're after. This article explains it in more detail:
t3267;negative;If you just want to test the build, you can suppress the lines concerning ChartFx from the .licx file created by Visual Studio. It should build this way, but probably will not execute correctly, as the license will not be included. The .licx file contains instructions to include binary license resource during build. I'm afraid that if you want a real build you have to install ChartFx on the build server.
t3268;neutral;"Configuraton doesn't belong in a library. I think you nailed it with ""emerging anti-pattern"". It's really pretty easy to locate configuration files relative to a library; they don't need to physically go in the same JAR to be found."
t3269;neutral;If there is no maximum a brute force attack can count on collisions too, i.e. the malicious user will be able to enter 1000 characters for example that produce the same hash as the original password with 8 symbols.
t3270;neutral;Undefined behavior if the character is not found. Also you should not use `strstr` (with or without the typo) if `strchr` would suffice.
t3272;positive;that's the hope :)
t3273;positive;PL/SQL Developer from Allaround Automations. I happily paid the $200 or so price for this. Excellent IDE (+ good Intellisense, + debugging capability) with easy creation and editing of PL/SQL packages, SPs, Triggers etc So much better than Toad.
t3276;positive;Hi I have designed a query that returns a set of data such as: What I want to do in SQL Reporting Services is to display data in a grid fashion. Such as For the dataset I provide. I want it to auto page break when needed, etc. Is there anything built in that I can use? Any recommendations on how to do this is greatly appreicated! Thanks.
t3277;negative;Linked lists have operations which a FIFO queue does not (enumerate the list, remove items from the middle, etc). So personally, I'd fear that if a list is used as a queue without encapsulation, then in future some fool (probably me) will fail to observe the FIFO constraint.
t3279;neutral;I am using the ShowWindow method from User32 to hide a window (cmd.exe) from the user (mainly to prevent them from closing it). When the user opens the form, the process is started, and hid, then when the form is closing the process is killed. However, when the form is opened again, it doesn't hide the window (and sometimes doesn't the first time) Can someone help me with this?
t3280;positive;"Then perhaps Might be of some help. If need be you could always do the registry editing yourself via API directly for the association... but up to you EDIT: Also read the comments there, some good points eg the use of quotes for paths with spaces: @""C:\SomePath\MyApp.exe """"%1"""""" Also permission issues for registry access esp with Vista... good luck :)"
t3281;negative;I am writing an application which uses the Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel assembly to export/import data from Excel spreadsheets. Everything was going fine (except for 1 based indexing and all those optional parameters!), until I tried to use conditional formatting. When I call Range.FormatConditions.Add I get a MissingMethodException telling me that no such method exists. This happens in both Vista and XP. Here's an example of the code that generates the exception:
t3282;neutral;Effectively what needs to happen is that changes I have marked as live or stable needs to be merged with the Live website. This effectively means I don't have to worry about accidently copying over files and if something goes wrong it could be reverted to the previous version again. I'll investigate post_commit hook but I'll have to find a way to do a backup first so that a problem with subversiondoesn't kill the site.
t3283;positive;That is really, really, really smart! Thanks.
t3284;neutral;Is it possible to compile and run OpenGL programs from under Cygwin? If yes, how?
t3286;positive;"not for my company, so I don't have to worry ;-)"
t3289;neutral;How do you use network sockets in Pascal?
t3290;positive;There is a book called which details pen and paper drawing and what you can gain from it. I think it has a lot of benefits, particularly that you can, very early on (and easily), modify what the end result will be without much effort, and then start off on the right foot.
t3291;positive;By creating datastore models that inherit from the Expando class I can make my model-entities/instances have dynamic properties. That is great! But what I want is the names of these dynamic properties to be determined at runtime. Is that possible? For example, Is this possible? If yes, how to do this? I have already tried some funny ways to do this but did not succeed :P Thanks in advance.
t3292;positive;Wow! 3 lines of code instead of a page... I wish I could vote +5.
t3293;positive;Came here to improve my home-grown image resizer and discovered The ImageResizer Library. It's EXCELLENT. +1 for Computer Linguist!
t3294;negative;i hate being that guy, but this is really not the way to do whatever you aretrying to do
t3296;neutral;Speed of data entry. We have data entry operators who hammer data in using the keyboard (and often just the numeric keypad) so it's impractical for them to reach for the mouse half way through an entry screen.
t3298;positive;"The paper is an excellent discussion on branching patterns such as the ""main line"" pattern you mention - it lists the options in the form of patterns together with discussion of anti-patterns. One of the authors is Robert Orenstein of Perforce."
t3300;negative;I've tried several other IDEs (the last one was eclipse) but always come crying back. The thing I end up missing most is homesite's 'tag insight' for all the html tags.
t3301;neutral;It comes down to 'designing for testability'. Ideally, you should not instantiate those COM objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object. Now, COM itself does provide a level of indirection and you could provide a mock object that provided a substitute for the real one but I suspect it would be a pain to create and I doubt if you'd get much help from an existing mocking framework.
t3302;neutral;Zip is correct. It's a folder structure with quite a few xml documents inside. A plain text option might not be desirable (multiple files to manage...)
t3303;negative;Link is now dead :(
t3305;negative;"I completely disagree with the answers so far. I feel that internal is a horrid idea, preventing another assembly from inheriting your types, or even using your internal types should the need for a workaround come about. Today, I had to use reflection in order to get to the internals of a System.Data.DataTable (I have to build a datatable lightning fast, without all of its checks), and I had to use reflection, since not a single type was available to me; they were all marked as internal."
t3306;positive;+1 excellent question. Personally I'm starting to think that externals should never have been allowed to track the HEAD of other repositories. Always specifying the exact revision of the external is much safer.
t3307;positive;I am not familiar with the instance manager, but I have used on several systems (including a remotely hosted server) with great success. It supports MySQL 5.0 and 4.1.
t3309;negative;I had to do this once in Notes for a plugin I was developing. What I ended up doing was editing the Notes template in the designer, and then writing some LotusScript behind it that called a .NET class via a DLL. So when you clicked the button, it triggered the event in the LotusScript, and then called the DLL, and passed the item information to it. I should also note that it was a freakin' bear to figure out because Notes documentation is terrible.
t3310;neutral;Request.AbsoluteURI
t3311;neutral;IIRC, the max baud was effectively limited only by the H/W - I wrote my config to allow up to 1.3Mb, but I was targeting modems over RS-232 so 115K was the max that I needed, and likely the max that I ever will.
t3312;neutral;My understanding is that APPLET is deprecated and OBJECT is the preferred tag to use for Java applets. Is this correct? A lot of Java applet examples, both on the web and in books, still seem to use the APPLET tag. Are there any browser compatibility issues that OBJECT suffers from (compared to APPLET)? Also, can you provide an example of proper OBJECT tag usage for Java applets?
t3313;positive;Good enough answer for me :) I get the same, lets hope they fix it soon because XBAP deployment I'm learning to love!
t3315;positive;Yep, StackOverflow is written in C#/ .NET and is a very successful example of a high-scale site.
t3316;neutral;Joel Lucsy: That implementation of SQLite is a mixed-mode assembly which is not supported by Silverlight. Only a pure managed implementation would work under the Silverlight CLR.
t3317;negative;Would one be violating the the terms of agreement with Google App Engine if one were to use Amazon's S3 service with Google App Engine? I do know there is restrictions on what you can and can't do but I was not sure of this. Having these two combined features, one could provide one heck of a system at a relatively low cost compared to hosting this with a hosting company. Has anyone done this already or have heard of an application that combines the two technologies?
t3319;neutral;You should try Type Hierarchy. Right Click the class and Open Type Hierarchy. There are so many option look for Show all inherited members. It can be found at the lover section of the Type Hierarchy Widget.
t3320;positive;I cannot recommend higher than you reading through the postings of Bart De Smet (), he is really brilliant when it comes to Lambda. His recent series covered dynamic Lambda, starting with Absolutely beautiful code.

t3326;positive;I am currently using the following jQuery script to highlight rows in my table, and it works great! This works great for tables of data where each row is truly a new record, however, I have run into an issue where I have records that take up two rows of data and would like to modify the jQuery so it renders something like: How would I accomplish this in jQuery where I want every 3rd row to have a class of 'alt1' and every 4th row to have a class of 'alt2'? Thanks in advance!
t3327;positive;Wow - why would someone vote to close? This is a great debate!!
t3329;neutral;When opening a file from your hard drive into your browser, where is the document root? To illustrate, given the following HTML code, if the page is opened from the local machine(file:///) then where should the css file be for the browser to find it?
t3330;negative;You can analyse changes using the TFS API down to the level of what files have changed, but to determine what content in a file has changed you need to use external tool/library. There is a comparison/merge tool that ships with Visual Studio Team Explorer but this is still an external tool that processes the changes at runtime. Just FYI. Edit: I think I may be completely wrong!
t3331;neutral;I'm in everyone else's boat, this would prove incredibly useful, especially in my case where I know I need to closely examine the last 4 revisions. Analogous experience with limiting the number of log messages displayed would make it very natural to limit the number of revisions one retrieves going back from the current version.
t3332;neutral;the link to the last article (Tips for Unit Testing) expired. Here is the link to the new article: http://devver.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/tips-for-unit-testing/

t3334;neutral;How can I check file permissions, without having to run operating system specific command via passthru() or exec()?
t3337;neutral;yeah, i had the same issue
t3338;negative;I am currently a college student and I don't feel that any of my classes have touched on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) nearly enough. I've been interning a company for a few years and I've been learning about SDLC from the internship, but I wanted to poll the crowd so I can branch out from that. What SLDC resources (books, websites, magazines, newsletters, etc.) do you use?
t3340;positive;is a popular choice. It's a full multimedia framework much like DirectShow or QuickTime, has the advantage of having legally licensed codecs available, and has excellent Python bindings.
t3341;neutral;I haven't noticed the sort of fear that you have. Do you have any specific examples?
t3343;neutral;I generally use a manual process: Look at the page, figure out the semantic elements, and build the HTML Slice up the images I think I'll need Start writing CSS Tweak and repeat different steps as necessary Got a better approach, or a tool?
t3344;positive;If you package this code in a class library like I did, you'll have to change the access modifier from `internal` to `public`. Excellent code, saved me a lot of time.
t3346;negative;Unless there is a very valid reason, passwords should hashed. Hashes result in fixed length strings. There is not space argument to make, unless the system is storing the actual password, which is arguably a terrible idea.
t3348;positive;Awesome! Thanks.

t3376;neutral;Have you considered overriding the administrative templates for the models in question? This provides an excellent overview of the process. In this particular situation, having a finer-grained level of control may be the best way to achieve the desired result.
t3377;negative;(For the record, I find the Infragistics WinForms controls to be considerably easier than their ASP.NET controls. I think a lot of their bad rep comes from the ASP.NET side of the world, where certain tasks become a major pain and their Viewstate usage is off the charts.)

t3405;neutral;MySQL is extremely cheap when you have the distro (or staff to build) that carries MySQL Enterprise edition. This is a High Availability version which offers multi-master replication over many servers. Pros are low (license-) costs after initial purchase of hardware (Gigs of RAM needed!) and time to set up. The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins, no full-text indexing, stored procesures (I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it's easier to run than the replication/proxy balancing setup that's available for PostgreSQL.

If the Vcl were upgraded to use the newer methods, this problem presumably wouldn't happen. At least this is my hunch.

t3442;negative;I host a project on CodePlex, but a bunch (200+) files need to have their extension changed. What is the easiest, least painful way to do this? I cant see myself doing them one by one in the IDE. Update: I know I can just remove and change them via the commandline/utility, and readd them, but that would lose history. Perhaps there is some commandline interface to TFS on CodePlex?

t3449;negative;I am about to alter the several tables in a massive system which I probably only understand around 10%. I want to add three columns. One of these is just a rename of an existing column. Part of me wants to :- Rename the column but worried about the impact on unknown parts of the system that use the old name. Append the three columns to the table therefore making the old column redundant (over time).

t3456;negative;Eruby is an external executable, while erb is a library within Ruby. You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files (e.g. quick-and-dirty PHP replacement), and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other Ruby script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible, but I'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites.
t3458;neutral;"Regarding selling agile, one angle of approach is proposing agile techniques as a way of reducing the ""project crunch"". By this I mean the overwhelming list of deferred issues, ""99% complete"" code and oversights that accumulate towards the end of the project. This normally causes a lot of stress and compromises in order to meet the deadline. If a development organisation has never experienced project crunch, it would be a big surprise to me. Therefore I think this is a neat way of locking into a some shared pain and suggesting agile techniques as a load-levelling technique should provoke some interest that can lead onto a more complete discussion of the methodology(s)."

t3460;neutral;My application has a frame that is loaded/navigated when certain top-level buttons are clicked. The problem is, one of the hosted pages has a frame of it's own, and is messing with the outer frame's navigation bar (clicking back and forward navigates the inner frame, as well as the outer frame). Is there any way to have the outer frame's navigation control only worry about its immediate contents?

t3463;negative;i��ll try this. string needs to be iterable. and while we are at it: how come java is so damn awful? no sane person would specify `remove` in an interface, just to add `throws UnsupportedOperationException - if the remove operation is not supported by this Iterator`.
t3465;neutral;I personally mark most methods and properties virtual. I use proxies and lazy loading alot, so I don't want to have to worry about changing things at a later date.

t3467;positive;Excellent question.
t3469;neutral;Calling a virtual function is slightly slower than calling a nonvirtual function. However, I don't think it matters how deep your inheritance tree is. But this is not a difference that you should normally be worried about.

t3472;negative;My guess would be from a colleague who wanted to scare this person out of ever using 'this' again. It can be fairly annoying when someone uses 'this' for every single thing they do.

t3525;neutral;Filip is both correct and incorrect, at least wrt to Java and ASP.NET. An applet can get access to the ASP.NET session by cheating. In my case, we added the session id as a parameter to the applet, which the applet then adds as a cookie in it's requests. Seems to work ok. (We encrypted the session id to foil those nasty hacker folk!)
t3526;neutral;Maybe, but that's not what he asked. He was worried instead about losing a pointer to that particular location in memory, which is a dubious concept in Python anyhow.

Any help you could offer would be greatly appreciated! Wish you the best!
t3546;negative;Can anyone think of a quick, easy and fullproof way of listing only ClearCase Remote Client views from UNIX? ct lsview obviously lists all the views, and you could search by looking at the Properties: section if you run a ct lsview -properties -full (gives you Properties: snapshot webview readwrite) then use a regex or something, but I'd be worried that someone calls their view 'webview' or something. Has anyone got a foolproof way? Am I missing a flag or something? If only there was -fmt on lsview :S

t3560;neutral;Using Rails, is there a reason why I should store attachments (could be a file of any time), in the filesystem instead of in the database? The database seems simpler to me, no need to worry about filesystem paths, structure, etc., you just look in your blob field. But most people seem to use the filesystem that it leaves me guessing that there must be some benefits to doing so that I'm not getting, or some disadvantages to using the database for such storage. (In this case, I'm using postgres).

When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the Notification Area/System tray, it is using the 32x32 format and Windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon, which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here's my code to put the icon in the system tray:

t3575;negative;The fact that this is even remotely possible in JavaScript scares me.
t3578;neutral;I've run into this problem a couple times now. Last time, I wanted to create an array of arrays (matrix) of BOOL's. I ended up encapsulating them in NSStrings, because apparently NSArray only has arrays of objects. This time, want an array of arrays again, but of CGPoints. I'm going to be using these to draw images to the screen. Is there a way to create an array of CGPoints without them being objects? Should I even worry about the memory/performance overhead of having a matrix of 96 objects?
t3579;positive;Thanks! This looks very promising!
t3580;neutral;In VB.NET 4.0, most of you probably know you don't need to explicitly write getters and setters for your Property declarations as follows: VB automatically creates private member variables called _Foo and _Foo2. It seems as though Microsoft and the VS team have adopted the _ convention, so I don't see an issue with it.

t3590;neutral;I know this doesn't answer your question directly, but it might be worth checking out the SQL Server 2005 migration tool for Access. I've never used the tool, but it might be worth using with SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to see if there are the same issues as you had with MySQL

t3616;negative;I have an existing javascript/flash -interaction kludge that sucks terribly. Now I've decided it'd be better to write a flash app that does the specific thing without the need to interact with javascript. Therefore I'd need to produce flash apps in linux, and I don't have money to throw at adobe right now (perhaps never if their software keeps being terrible). Also not going to do software development on windows, have been there, conclusion: that's not going to work well ever. So, any solutions? Free or open source?

t3643;negative;Is there a sensible way to group Long UTC dates by Day? I would Mod them by 86400 but that doesn't take leap seconds into account. Does anyone have any other ideas, I'm using java so I could parse them into Date Objects, but I'm a little worried of the performance overhead of using the date class. Also is there a more efficient way than comparing the year month and day parts of a Date object?
t3644;negative;I do hate the plain id name. I strongly prefer to always use the invoice_id or a variant thereof. I always know which table is the authoritative table for the id when I need to, but this confuses me What's worst of all is the mix you mention, totally confusing. I've had to work with a database where almost always it was foo_id except in one of the most used ids. That was total hell.
t3645;positive;Very good one, thanks!!
t3646;positive;Like others I'm using larger fonts, since getting on the plus side of fifty. Most recently I started using the Consolas typeface and have really enjoyed it. Fixed width indents well.

t3660;positive;I really liked learning ML at college. I find functional programming often a refreshingly elegant way to write certain algorithms. I have heard of F# and played around with that a bit. Still, I've written some interesting functions in ML and would like to integrate them as libraries I could use in other applications. Usually I paste my functions into the SMLnj interpreter. Is there a way I can compile them down?
t3661;positive;This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of IIS and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers

t4054;positive;Agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed. Apart from that, if you are worried about table size, you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line. Don't worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up, and don't optimise prematurely.

In the Dequeue, send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove, the item removed, and index 0.

There are no build events on the solution property page, so what should I do?

t4242;neutral;Not really, no. I basically just took JaredPar's word for it that the threadID would be reasonably stable, used this during testing, and then changed the interface to react to OnMouseMove events instead for the final deployment. I didn't do that originally because it means passing events up through a whole chain of Controls and is generally just a pain in the ass. It is, however, more reliable than the above method, which only failed once or twice during the whole of testing, but did fail.
